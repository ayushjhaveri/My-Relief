# My-Relief

There already exist mobile apps for disaster alerts, but what about our safety during a disasater? How many rescuers can there be? The population in India can never be entirely assisted.
But wouldn't it be amazing if everyone could volunteer, if everyone is aware of who needs immediate assistance, if everyone could help everyone. <br />
<br />MY RELIEF makes this possible.
<br />Users can request for aid during a disaster. All other users within a 5km radius will be notified immediately.
